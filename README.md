# python
Trying to learn a bit of python.

## General structure
```
/
├── config.ini
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── src/
    └── main.py
```
I find this structure quite nice for my smaller projects. The Dockerfile is useful if the project can use it.

The only requirement that I have set for myself is that code should be in a `src` directory.  
There should also be a `README.md` file that explains the function of the project.  
`requirements.txt` should always be available if there are imports in the code.

`config.ini` is a nice to have, more for me so I don't have to input things manually.  
`Dockerfile` if it's viable.
